# üëã Hi there, I'm Sanskruti Khandekar
I'm a Data Analyst who loves digging into data to uncover the "aha!" moments. With a year of hands-on experience, I've been wrangling data with SQL and Python, building eye-catching dashboards in Power BI, Tableau,Excel and Google Data Studio, and helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.

Whether it‚Äôs cleaning messy datasets, visualizing trends, or optimizing data pipelines ‚Äî I‚Äôm all about turning numbers into stories. I‚Äôve worked with cross-functional teams, tackled real-world business challenges, and delivered insights that actually made a difference.

Big fan of structured thinking, good design, and coffee-fueled debugging.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
