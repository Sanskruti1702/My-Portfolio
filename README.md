# üëã Hi there, I'm Sanskruti Khandekar
I'm a Data Analyst who loves digging into data to uncover the "aha!" moments. With a year of hands-on experience, I've been wrangling data with SQL and Python, building eye-catching dashboards in Power BI, Tableau,Excel and Google Data Studio, and helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.

Whether it‚Äôs cleaning messy datasets, visualizing trends, or optimizing data pipelines ‚Äî I‚Äôm all about turning numbers into stories. I‚Äôve worked with cross-functional teams, tackled real-world business challenges, and delivered insights that actually made a difference.

Big fan of structured thinking, good design, and coffee-fueled debugging.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# üóÉÔ∏è Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
## 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma
Aim- To enhance real-world SQL skills by solving case-based business problems

Description- The 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma is a collection of 8 business-focused case studies designed to strengthen SQL problem-solving skills. Each case simulates a real-world domain like food delivery, digital subscriptions, retail inventory, or banking ‚Äî with tasks ranging from data cleaning and transformation to advanced analytics using joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregations.

[Details and code](https://github.com/Sanskruti1702/8-Weeks-SQL-Challenges-By-Danny-Ma)

üß†Skills- Data Cleaning & Preparation, JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, Filtering and transforming data using WHERE, CASE, COALESCE, Date & time manipulation with SQL functions, Applying window functions (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG())

üõ†Technology - SQL

Conclusion- Built confidence in using SQL for exploratory data analysis, performance tracking, customer behavior insights, and operational decision-making.

## Case Studies for EDA (Python)
Aim- To explore, clean, and analyze real-world datasets using Python in order to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can inform business or operational decisions

Description- These case studies involve performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various structured datasets from domains such as gaming, retail, finance, and marketing. Each project focuses on understanding the data, handling inconsistencies, generating summary statistics, visualizing key trends, and drawing data-driven conclusions. Some also include business logic implementation, feature engineering, and metric design.

[Details and code](https://github.com/Sanskruti1702/Python-Case-studies)

üß†Skills- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Exploratory Analysis & Summary Statistics, Time Series Breakdown & Trend Detection, Business Understanding & Insight Development, Data Visualization with Python

Technology- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, excel/csv

Conclusion- These EDA case studies demonstrate the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through structured analysis and storytelling. By combining analytical thinking with Python tooling, each project provides clear takeaways that can support better decisions in product, marketing, or operations.
