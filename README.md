# üëã Hi there, I'm Sanskruti Khandekar
I'm a Data Analyst who loves digging into data to uncover the "aha!" moments. With a year of hands-on experience, I've been wrangling data with SQL and Python, building eye-catching dashboards in Power BI, Tableau,Excel and Google Data Studio, and helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.

Whether it‚Äôs cleaning messy datasets, visualizing trends, or optimizing data pipelines ‚Äî I‚Äôm all about turning numbers into stories. I‚Äôve worked with cross-functional teams, tackled real-world business challenges, and delivered insights that actually made a difference.

Big fan of structured thinking, good design, and coffee-fueled debugging.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# üóÉÔ∏è Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
## 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma
Aim- To enhance real-world SQL skills by solving case-based business problems

Description- The 8 Week SQL Challenge by Danny Ma is a collection of 8 business-focused case studies designed to strengthen SQL problem-solving skills. Each case simulates a real-world domain like food delivery, digital subscriptions, retail inventory, or banking ‚Äî with tasks ranging from data cleaning and transformation to advanced analytics using joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregations.

[Details and code](https://github.com/Sanskruti1702/8-Weeks-SQL-Challenges-By-Danny-Ma)

üß†Skills- Data Cleaning & Preparation, JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, Filtering and transforming data using WHERE, CASE, COALESCE, Date & time manipulation with SQL functions, Applying window functions (e.g., RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG())

üõ†Technology - SQL

Conclusion- Built confidence in using SQL for exploratory data analysis, performance tracking, customer behavior insights, and operational decision-making.

## Case Studies for EDA (Python)
Aim- To explore, clean, and analyze real-world datasets using Python in order to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can inform business or operational decisions

Description- These case studies involve performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various structured datasets from domains such as gaming, retail, finance, and marketing. Each project focuses on understanding the data, handling inconsistencies, generating summary statistics, visualizing key trends, and drawing data-driven conclusions. Some also include business logic implementation, feature engineering, and metric design.

[Details and code](https://github.com/Sanskruti1702/Python-Case-studies)

üß†Skills- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Exploratory Analysis & Summary Statistics, Time Series Breakdown & Trend Detection, Business Understanding & Insight Development, Data Visualization with Python

Technology- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, excel/csv

Conclusion- These EDA case studies demonstrate the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through structured analysis and storytelling. By combining analytical thinking with Python tooling, each project provides clear takeaways that can support better decisions in product, marketing, or operations.

## Web Scraping Scripts 
Aim- To build automated web scraping tools using Python to collect structured, high-value data from dynamic websites for business insights and product development during my tenure as a Data Analyst.

Description- These projects involved designing and implementing custom Python-based web scrapers tailored to specific client needs.
- Canada Weather Data Scraper:
Developed using Selenium, this scraper extracted weather data across various Canadian regions. The data included temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed, which was then used by an e-commerce client to analyze how regional weather patterns impacted the sales of agricultural products like pulses, cereals, and millets.

- iGaming Market Performance Scraper:
Built a scraping solution to collect game performance metrics from multiple online iGaming operator websites. The scraper handled varied layouts and anti-bot mechanisms to gather competitor data such as popularity scores, game rankings, and update frequencies. The clean datasets supported the launch of a game benchmarking platform used for market research and competitive analysis.

[Details and code](https://github.com/Sanskruti1702/Python-web-scraping-scripts)

üß†Skills- Web scraping with Python, Dynamic content handling with Selenium, HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup, Data cleaning and structuring, Anti-bot strategy handling, Domain-specific data extraction

Technology- Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, ChromeDriver, CSV, SQLite

Conclusion- These web scraping tools automated critical data collection processes for clients across two domains‚ÄîeCommerce and iGaming. The insights derived helped improve sales forecasting, market analysis, and product development efficiency, replacing time-consuming manual processes with reliable, scalable automation.
