# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sanskruti Khandekar
I'm a Data Analyst who loves digging into data to uncover the "aha!" moments. With a year of hands-on experience, I've been wrangling data with SQL and Python, building eye-catching dashboards in Power BI, Tableau,Excel and Google Data Studio, and helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.

Whether it’s cleaning messy datasets, visualizing trends, or optimizing data pipelines — I’m all about turning numbers into stories. I’ve worked with cross-functional teams, tackled real-world business challenges, and delivered insights that actually made a difference.

Big fan of structured thinking, good design, and coffee-fueled debugging.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
